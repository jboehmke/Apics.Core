Make sure to create the event logs since the application will not have rights to do this unless elevation is requested
through the UAC.
    - Add keys "Aptify.ExceptionManagerInternalException" and "Aptify.ExceptionManagerPublishedException"
        to "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\eventlog\Application"

- If an error occurs on first run, run again to reload the DLLs.  This is an issue that when the DLLs are 
    loaded from the Aptify database, the Aptify API requests the DLL too late.  On the second run, the 
    DLL will already be cached and ready to load.  If you do have this problem, add the DLL to the configuration
    file.
